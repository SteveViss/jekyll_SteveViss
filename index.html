<h2>Welcome,</h2>

<p>I'm Steve Vissault, master's candidate in forest ecology at the <a href="http://www.uqar.ca/"> Université du Québec à Rimouski</a>. I'm developing an empirical model in order to assess range shift and migration rate of the temperate forest under climate change. I'm working with <a href="http://chaire-eec.uqar.ca/">Dominique Gravel's lab</a> focusing on theoretical ecology. I mostly use R and C as programming languages and PostgreSQL, LateX, Markdown as computional tools to develop and manage this project.</p>

<p>This research project is part of a larger project called <a href="http://quicc-for.uqar.ca/">QUICC-FOR</a> wherein I'm involved to merge many forest databases from several provenances (USA, CAN) into one final relational database. </p>
