<p> A majority of studies on ecotones, which are transitional areas expected to be
  particularly sensitive to climate change, focus on the transition between forest
  and non-forest ecosystems. However, little attention has been given to evaluate
  the dynamics between two forest ecosytems such as the temporate-boreal ecotone.
  The equilibrium distribution of the two forest types is largely related to
  climate at the continental scale, and it is therefore expected that temperate
  trees will expand northward in the coming decades. However, the observed
  distribution of the two forests in the ecotone area is patchy and highly
  variable, suggesting that they may coexist as alternative stable states under
  the same climatic conditions at the landscape scale. We hypothesize that a
  positive plant-soil feedback may operate, as both types of forest stands change
  the seedbed conditions in a way that favours their own regeneration. If this
  hypothesis is correct, the initial composition of patches would influence the
  migration of temperate tree species. Otherwise, the patchiness might be the
  result of transient dynamics.  </p>

  <p> We explore these hypotheses using a state and
    transition model of landscape dynamics, parameterized on an extensive database
    of 160,000 forest plots widely distributed along a latitudinal gradient in the
    east of America. We found that the observed
    transitions between the different states successfully predicted the location of
    the ecotone. We also found, despite the absence of alternative stable states, a
    significant variability in landscape composition at the transition between
    temperate and boreal forests suggesting that some part of the landscape is
    currently transient, creating the patchy structure that we observe. These
    results emphasize the role of disturbances such as fire or logging which
    maintain a high proportion of transcient forests. This model predicts not only the equilibrium state but also the
    transitions and delay to reach the equilibrium forest composition, which is of
    prime importance for forest management. </p>
